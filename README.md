   ```

   **iOS:**
   - Add camera permissions to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app needs camera access to scan electricity bills</string>
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app needs photo library access to import bill images</string>
