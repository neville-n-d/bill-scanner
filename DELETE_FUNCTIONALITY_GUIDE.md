## Implementation Details

### Swipe-to-Delete Implementation

```dart
Dismissible(
  key: Key(bill.id),
  direction: DismissDirection.endToStart, // Swipe left
  background: _buildDeleteBackground(),
  confirmDismiss: (direction) => _showDeleteConfirmation(context, bill),
  onDismissed: (direction) {
    _deleteBill(context, bill);
  },
  child: BillCard(bill: bill),
)
```

### Delete Background Design

```dart
Widget _buildDeleteBackground() {
  return Container(
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      color: Colors.red,
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
    ),
    child: const Align(
      alignment: Alignment.centerRight,
      child: Row(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end,
        children: [
          Icon(Icons.delete, color: Colors.white),
          Text('Delete', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

### Confirmation Dialog

```dart
Future<bool?> _showDeleteConfirmation(BuildContext context, ElectricityBill bill) {
  return showDialog<bool>(
    context: context,
    builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
      title: const Text('Delete Bill'),
      content: Text('Are you sure you want to delete the bill from ${DateFormat('MMM dd, yyyy').format(bill.billDate)}?'),
      actions: [
        TextButton(onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context, false), child: const Text('Cancel')),
        TextButton(onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context, true), child: const Text('Delete')),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```

## User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback

- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if deletion fails

### Bulk Operations
- **Selection Counter**: Shows number of selected items in app bar

## Data Management

### Database Operations
- **Local Deletion**: Removes bill from local SQLite database
- **Image Cleanup**: Deletes associated image files

### Error Handling
